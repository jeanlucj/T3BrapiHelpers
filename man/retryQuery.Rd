\title{Retry an Expression Multiple Times on Error}
\usage{
retryQuery(query, max_tries = 10, wait = 3, silent = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A quoted R expression (usually wrapped with \code{quote()}).}

\item{max_tries}{Integer. Maximum number of attempts before giving up.}

\item{wait}{Numeric. Number of seconds to pause between attempts.}

\item{silent}{Logical. Whether to suppress error messages from each failed
attempt. Default \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
The value of \code{query} if successful; otherwise \code{NULL} after exhausting
all attempts.
}
\description{
\code{retryQuery()} repeatedly evaluates an expression that may fail (e.g.,
network I/O, timeouts, or API calls). If the expression throws an error, the
function waits a specified number of seconds and tries again, up to a maximum
number of attempts.
}
\details{
This helper is intended for \strong{internal package use only} and is especially
useful for wrapping fragile operations such as BrAPI queries, \code{httr} requests,
or file I/O when intermittent failures are likely.

The function returns the value of the expression as soon as it succeeds
(i.e., does not throw an error). If all attempts fail, \code{NULL} is returned
invisibly after issuing a final message.
}
\examples{
# A failing expression that will succeed on the 3rd try
i <- 0
result <- retryQuery(
  quote({
    i <<- i + 1
    if (i < 3) stop("Temporary failure")
    "Success!"
  }),
  max_tries = 5,
  wait = 0.1
)
result

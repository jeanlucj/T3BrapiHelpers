\title{For a study_id, find other studies having a minimum number common accessions}
\usage{
find_other_studies_evaluating_same_germplasm(
  study_id,
  brapiConn,
  min_germ_common = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_id}{A BrAPI study IDs to query}

\item{brapiConn}{A BrAPI connection object, created by
\code{BrAPI::createBrAPIConnection()}}

\item{min_germ_common}{An integer of the minimum number of germplasms in
common for the study to be included in the response}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per trial
other_studies: the studyDbId and
n: the number of germplasms in common with the focal study
}
\description{
For a BrAPI study ID, get the germplasm evaluated in it
Find other studies where those same germplasms were evaluated
Select studies where a minimum number of germplasms are in common with the
focal study ID
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
brapiConn <- BrAPI::createBrAPIConnection("T3/Wheat", is_breedbase = TRUE)

# Retrieve other studies based on a focal study
df <- find_other_studies_evaluating_same_germplasm("10674", brapiConn)
